<p>I am a <del>third</del> fourth year PhD student at Department of Computational and Data Science (CDS) at Indian Institute of Science. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/"><strong>Prof.</strong> <strong>Venkatesh Babu</strong></a>. Currently I am working on intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am supported by <a href="http://pmrf.in/"><strong>Prime Ministerâ€™s Research Fellowship</strong></a> in Computer Science. I previously completed an honors degree in Computer Science being jointly advised by <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sangal/web/"><strong>Dr</strong>. <strong>Rajeev</strong> <strong>Sangal</strong></a> and <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sangal/web/"><strong>Dr</strong>. <strong>A</strong>.<strong>K</strong>. <strong>Singh</strong></a> at Department of Computer Science, IIT BHU Varanasi. In the past I have interned with Amazon in Outbound Marketing Automtation team and also have been the lead maintainer of the placement portal <a href="www.placement.iitbhu.ac.in">site</a>. In my free time I like to read books and play basketball.</p>

<h3 id="research-interests">Research Interests:</h3>

<p>My research interest lies in the field of Adversarial Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in problems that involve min-max optimizations. Adversarial Learning is the common theme behind the following techniques Generative Adversarial Networks, Adversarial Training for robust Neural Networks, Adversarial Domain Adaptation, etc. As a long-term goal, I want to develop ML algorithms that train and generalize well on real-world datasets. Currently, I am working on Generative Adversarial Networks where I want to tackle the case of learning from imbalanced datasets. Along with this, I am also focusing on analyzing the nature of practical min-max optimization methods used in Deep Learning.</p>
