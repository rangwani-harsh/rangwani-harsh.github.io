I am a ~~second~~ third year PhD student at Department of Computational and Data Science (CDS) at Indian Institute of Science. I am very fortunate to be advised by [**Prof.** **Venkatesh Babu**](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/). Currently I am working on intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am supported by [**Prime Minister's Research Fellowship**](http://pmrf.in/) in Computer Science. I previously completed an honors degree in Computer Science being jointly advised by [**Dr**. **Rajeev** **Sangal**](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sangal/web/) and [**Dr**. **A**.**K**. **Singh**](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sangal/web/) at Department of Computer Science, IIT BHU Varanasi. In the past I have interned with Amazon in Outbound Marketing Automtation team and also have been the lead maintainer of the placement portal [site](www.placement.iitbhu.ac.in). In my free time I like to read books and play basketball. 

### Current Research Interests:

My research interest lie in the field of Adversarial Machine Learning. Specifically I am interested in problems which involve min max optimizations. Adversarial Learning is the common theme behind the following techniques Generative Adversarial Networks, Adversarial Training for robust Neural Networks, Adversarial Domain Adaptation etc. Currently I am working on Generative Adversarial Networks where I want to tackle the case of learning from imbalanced datasets. 

<!-- ### Courses completed in IISc (GPA: 9.83) :
